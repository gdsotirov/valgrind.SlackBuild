valgrind: Valgrind (A debugging and profiling suite)
valgrind:
valgrind: Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic
valgrind: analysis tools.  There are Valgrind tools that can automatically
valgrind: detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile
valgrind: your programs in detail.  You can also use Valgrind to build new
valgrind: tools.
valgrind: The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality
valgrind: tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache
valgrind: and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and
valgrind: branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler.  It also includes
valgrind: three experimental tools: a heap/stack/global array overrun
valgrind: detector, a second heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are
valgrind: used, and a SimPoint basic block vector generator.  It runs on the
valgrind: following platforms: X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
valgrind: PPC64/Linux, X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin (Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6).
